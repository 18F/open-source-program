Open source is about more than just publishing a project's source code. Successful open source projects focus on growing communities around shared challenges. Here are some best practices to ensure your open source community thrives:

#### Communicate the big picture

* Open source problems, not solutions
* Publish a readme as early as possible
* Describe the project's goals and the founders' vision
* Sketch out a rough development roadmap and project timeline
* Communicate the project's current status

#### One class of developers

* Strive to maintain an equality of information sharing and opportunities to contribute to the project between internal and external developers
* Maintain one public bug tracker and make the public repository your primary repository
* Minimize (and memorialize) in-person discussions

#### Encourage contributions

* Document how to contribute in the project readme
* Provide constructive and supportive feedback on proposed contributions
* Express gratitude prior to merging pull requests or responding to issues
* Minimize friction through tooling
* Document technical requirements and how to run the project locally
* Automate testing using third-party continuous integration services

#### Governance

* Community managers should ensure contributors (both internal and external) have the resources and involvement they need to thrive
* Decentralize decision making authority to technical stakeholders and subject-matter experts
* Provide clear and consistent value to all non-technical stakeholders, regardless of role

#### Types of stakeholders

* Non-technical, non-user
* Potential users
* Non-technical users
* Veteran (or curious) users
* Subject-matter experts (accessability, content, localization)
* Technical users
* Active contributors
* Potential contributors

#### Opportunities to contribute

* Kick the tires â€” does it do what it says it does?
* What features would you love to see?
* Improving documentation
* Community evangelism
* Help answer Q&A in the forums
* Staff a genius bar at local meetups
* Translate the project to additional languages
* Provide feedback on proposed bug fixes or features
* Develop new features, improve existing ones
* Recruit new developers
