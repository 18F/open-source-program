      * Mailing list

      * Possibly explain how yours differs
* Documentation
   * Setup instructions
   * Usage examples
   * Method-level
      * especially if it's a library

         * rdoc.info
         * readthedocs
         * docco
   * Version it
      * Even easier if it's in the same repository as the code - changes can/should happen simultaneously
* Demos
   * Live, for app/frontend project
   * Example implementation
* coverage
   * automated tests
   * humans
      * someone to take the reins, in case you get hit by a bus
      * someone to bounce ideas off of
* Issues
   * make Issues public
      * issue tracker/roadmap that isn't publicly visible makes it difficult for others to dive in
   * Labels
      * "help wanted"
      * "beginner-friendly"
* CONTRIBUTING
   * Explain requirements
      * CLA
   * sometimes ask before you make changes, sometimes don't
      * Encourage proposals before big changes
      * "Show me the code"
   * WIP PRs are ok
   * Instruct if you prefer commits be rebased
* license
* Advertisement
   * This is marketing
      * Strong users are most likely to become contributors/maintainers, so take care of them
   * Mailing lists
   * Talks
      * Meetups / user groups
      * Conferences
   * Stack Overflow answers
   * GitHub profile pages (orgs especially) are not a great way to showcase projects
      * https://github.com/showcases/open-source-organizations
   * Bounty programs
      * HH resources

* Releases
   * Semantic versioning w/ corresponding tags
