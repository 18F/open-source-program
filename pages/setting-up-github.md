## Setting up GitHub at Your Agency

### Background 

On Aug. 8, 2016, OMB [released M-16-21](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), a policy directing federal agencies to advance their open source efforts in a number of ways. Agencies can integrate open source practices and satisfy the policy's directives without using GitHub.  [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/), and [other services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source_code_hosting_facilities) offer similar capabilities.  That said, GitHub has proven immensely popular with developers, both worldwide and in government - it's approximately the [50th most popular website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites) on the internet and [over 100 federal agencies and programs](https://government.github.com/community/#us-federal) are using the service, far more than any other services.  There are functional benefits driving this popularity and an agency that does not currently have an open source hub can benefit from the decision-making already done by those agencies.  It's incredibly easy for a federal agency to quickly and safely set up a presence on GitHub as a pilot.  This page attempts to help with that.

### How to Set Up An Organization

#### Agencies not yet using GitHub...

* GSA has coordinated with GitHub to ensure that its terms of service are government-friendly out of the box.  
* There's no cost to using GitHub by default, so you can set up your GitHub organization without needing to do a procument. 
* By default, GitHub does not have access to agency systems or code when you set up a GitHub organization.  It takes a proactive, intentional effort to share code or information on the site.  Until you do, your GitHub organization is entirely outside your agency's security perimeter.  
* The best way to start is slowly - Create a GitHub user account and then the agency organization.  Use the organization permissions to grant access to your team and appropriate stakeholders.  
* Encourage team members to go through the [beginner's guides](https://guides.github.com/) and learn basic tasks like creating, editing, forking, and managing a repository.  
* Staff can use their personal GitHub accounts to experiment and become used to the interface without contributing anything to the agency organization.  
* Convene a working group to decide how to pilot the use of the agency's GitHub organization and to expand and manage access and workflows.  

#### Agencies already using GitHub...

If your agency or department [already has a GitHub organization](https://government.github.com/community/#type-us-federal), you should be able to see who its current users are and ask for access.  If you have trouble though, feel free to contact GitHub's [government support](government@github.com) and they can put you in touch.  

### Why start now?  

* There is no risk or cost to setting up a GitHub organization for your agency.  
* The best way to learn about a service and evaluate its fit for your agency is by using it.  You can set up a Github organization without sharing any non-public material and limit access to the org while your team is researching how best to use it.  
* A successful pilot can be easily run with already public data, already public source code, and with simple 'hello world' projects that are started from scratch.  
* Engaging with open source is now a basic norm for any technical organization.  It's important to engage with this community in order to keep up technologically - setting up and scaling out your agency's GitHub presence is a good way to do that.  
* Just as with Twitter or YouTube, there will be increasing value in having secured as good of a handle as possible.  If github.com/agency or github.com/agency.abbreviation is available now, it won't always be.  Go ahead and secure it by setting up your github organization there so that you're not in a position of having to use a longer, more cumbersome handle for the rest of time because someone else got to a shorter more desirable one first.

### How to Do More Research

If you want more venues to research what other agencies have done, check out the below and don't hesitate to speak up on the forums and ask questions.  

* Subscribe to the [government open source](https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!forum/government-open-source) and [MIL-OSS](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mil-oss) listserves and review their archives.  
* Go through their companion websites - [Government Open Source](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-program/) and [MIL-OSS](http://mil-oss.org/).  
* Read through GitHub's [Government website](https://government.github.com/).  
* Join GitHub's [government community](https://github.com/government/welcome).  There's a substantive [best practices forum](https://github.com/government/best-practices) available to anyone with a government email address that has been the source of a lot of good discussion.  


Hopefully, the above material is useful.  It'll be up to you, though, to get started.  Anyone can start up a GitHub organization for an agency, coordinate internally on who should have access, transfer management of it for longer term administration.  But if a pilot is to take place, someone has to start it.  :)
