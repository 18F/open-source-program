### Background 

On Aug. 8, 2016, OMB [released M-16-21](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), a policy directing federal agencies to advance their open source efforts in a number of ways. Agencies can integrate open source practices and satisfy the policy's directives without using GitHub.  [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/), and [other services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source_code_hosting_facilities) offer similar capabilities.  That said, GitHub has proven immensely popular with developers, both worldwide and in government - it's approximately the [50th most popular website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites) on the internet and [over 100 federal agencies and programs](https://government.github.com/community/#us-federal) are using the service, far more than any other services.  There are functional benefits driving this popularity and an agency that does not currently have an open source hub can benefit from the decision-making already done by those agencies.  It's incredibly easy for a federal agency to quickly and safely set up a presence on GitHub as a pilot.  This page attempts to help with that.
