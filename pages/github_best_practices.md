* Create an organization for the top level agency, then set up teams for smaller components and reach out to points of contact in each to offer access and ask them to manage access to their team.  
* Keep the list of owners finite since that is the one permission level that can impact the organization in a substantial and permanent way.  
* Otherwise though, err in the direction of giving most or all members of your organization admin access to their repositories.  
* Ask that your organization's members add a headshot, ensure that they have their name populated, and make their membership in the organization public.  
* Ensure that your organization has a profile picture uploaded.  
* Include an email and URL in the organization's profile to better connect with your organization's efforts. 
* Organization members should not create a second GitHub account 'for work'.  Instead, simply add your work email to your GitHub account and associate your work projects with that email address.
