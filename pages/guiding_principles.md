#### We believe [^1]

- Distributing OSS helps to foster public trust.
- Collaborating on OSS projects creates higher quality software and _directly_ 
  serves the public at large  
- OSS can be very cost-effective as it bypasses the need to procure software licenses
- OSS focuses on learning and developing skills rather than on procurement
