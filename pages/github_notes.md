### Improving your account profile


#### Add your name to your account


This makes it a lot easier for your teammates to know who's account it is and to administer the teams, but most of all it helps a lot with autocomplete in a bunch of situations.  

Please make sure that you go to [your settings page](https://github.com/settings/profile) and make sure your name (first and last) is filled in.

Pop quiz - who is easier to collaborate with here?  :)

#### Add a profile picture

This is a simple courtesy that makes team projects all the more social and fun.  It only takes a second but your teammates will appreciate it. We are not dogmatic that it be a headshot, but please make it unique.

It only takes a moment to go to [your settings page](https://github.com/settings/profile) and upload a profile picture.
